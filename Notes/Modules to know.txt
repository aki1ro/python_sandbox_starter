Web development modules:

requests = used for http

django = back end web framework for Python


flask = competitor to django, also a framework. Works similar to django, flask is easier and faster to setup. lightweight.

twisted = online game developement is one of it's purposes. communication between clients and servers

beautifulsoup = for webscraping, trying to grab html data

selenium = used to automation on websites, access html fields, click, mouser cursor.

Data science modules:

numpy = module for doing mathematical operations in python, matrices, 2d/3d/4d/5d math fast as alot of operations are written in C

pandas = used for reading and working with data in general

matplotlib = used for data visualization, plots, charts, etc. Also good for machine learning. visualization of funtions etc. 

nltk = natural langauge toolkit = used for data/text processing, want to remove things like spaces, etc from text based data. 

opencv = main focus is on image and video data processing, feature detection and description. extremely strong module for doing anything with image/video data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine Learning/ AI:

tensorflow = google module, extremely powerful, standard machine learning algorithms, neural networks, etc. 

keras = higher level API for tensorflow, mainted and supported by google. allows to access tensorflow features in an easier way, doing things quickly.

pytorch = another module for machine learning, and AI. a little behind tensorflow

scikit-learn = not as powerful as the above modules, used for clusering algorithms, lightweight module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphical User Interface:

kivy = for building applications that will scale all different platforms. 

PyQt5 = best graphical user interface builder for python. can use css3 styling to style application.

tkinter = older module, similar to pyqt5, not as capable. easier for beginners. 

Gaming:

pygame = module for building simple games.
