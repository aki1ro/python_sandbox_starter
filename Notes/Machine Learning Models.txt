Machine learning is just geometry
All data is the same: problem stays the same(geometry) and ML algorithm doesn't care about
what the data means to use

Supervised vs Unsupervised:

   Supervised Learning = has labeled historical data that we will be used to inform our model
   We call the label or thing we're trying to predict the "target" which is known in Supervised learning

   Unsupervised Learning = labled historical data that will be used by our model to predict
   and unknown "target"

These both are types of Supervised learning:

Regression is trying to fit a line or curve to some data points by predicting a number:
statistics, geometry. In regression we try to make the line as close to the data points as
possible, also known as line of best fit. target in this type of learning are own as a numerical value.
   
   many real world datasets are non-linear

Classification is trying to classify an object and predict the category/label. we use the line to separate data points of different colors (classes). line is used as a decision boundary. target in this are known as categorical values (often True or False, but can be multiple catagories)

   can be complex with boundary decisions.

   An algorithm used for solving Classification problems is called Logistic Regression, not to be confused with Regression type learning.

   Classification Terminology:
      Target = column that represents what we're trying to predict
      Feature/Predictors = columns that contain the information used to predict the target

   Linear Classification Theory:\
   
   The challenge of building the model will be determining what the best possible line is.
