1. Some of the methods offered by strings are:

capitalize() – changes all string letters to capitals;
center() – centers the string inside the field of a known length;
count() – counts the occurrences of a given character;
join() – joins all items of a tuple/list into one string;
lower() – converts all the string's letters into lower-case letters;
lstrip() – removes the white characters from the beginning of the string;
replace() – replaces a given substring with another;
rfind() – finds a substring starting from the end of the string;
rstrip() – removes the trailing white spaces from the end of the string;
split() – splits the string into a substring using a given delimiter;
strip() – removes the leading and trailing white spaces;
swapcase() – swaps the letters' cases (lower to upper and vice versa)
title() – makes the first letter in each word upper-case;
upper() – converts all the string's letter into upper-case letters.

2. String content can be determined using the following methods (all of them return Boolean values):

endswith() – does the string end with a given substring?
isalnum() – does the string consist only of letters and digits?
isalpha() – does the string consist only of letters?
islower() – does the string consists only of lower-case letters?
isspace() – does the string consists only of white spaces?
isupper() – does the string consists only of upper-case letters?
startswith() – does the string begin with a given substring?
