In general, a typical function invocation may look like this:

result = function(arg)

he function takes an argument, does something, and returns a result.

A typical method invocation usually looks like this:

result = data.method(arg)

Lists (and many other complex Python entities) are stored in different ways than ordinary (scalar) variables.

You could say that:

the name of an ordinary variable is the name of its content;
the name of a list is the name of a memory location where the list is stored.

3 Conditions for writing your own function:

We can now define the first condition which can help you decide when to start writing your own functions: if a particular fragment of the code begins to appear in more than one place, consider the possibility of isolating it in the form of a function invoked from the points where the original code was placed before.

We can now state the second condition: if a piece of code becomes so large that reading and understating it may cause a problem, consider dividing it into separate, smaller problems, and implement each of them in the form of a separate function.

This leads us directly to the third condition: if you're going to divide the work among multiple programmers, decompose the problem to allow the product to be implemented as a set of separately written functions packed together in different modules.
