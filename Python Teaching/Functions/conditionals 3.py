'''
Youâ€™re making a gold purity checker, that should accept only 22K or 24K gold. Only the good stuff!

22K gold has 91.7% or more gold in it, while 24K corresponds to 99.9% and above purity.

Given the % of gold purity as input, you should output "Accepted" only if it corresponds to 22 or 24K.

if purity >= 99.9:
    print("Accepted")
elif purity < 99.9 and purity >= 91.7:
    print("Accepted")
